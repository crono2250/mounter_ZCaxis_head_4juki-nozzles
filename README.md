# mounter_ZCaxis_head_4juki-nozzles
Head assembly for my OpenPnp mounter

By gently widening the cylinder like a trumpet, the position error in the XY direction is tolerated, and the position is fixed by grabbing it with a magnet with a hole and having the nozzle holder's flange surface contact it closely.  <br>
As a result, a positional error of about 1 mm in the XY direction can be tolerated when grabbing.<br>
<br>
The material is SUS316 and the nozzle is grabbed by a hollow neodymium magnet.<br>
The longer the motor is extended from the axis, the more it is affected by forces from the direction perpendicular to the axis...XY direction.<br>
To solve the problem of shaft bending due to lateral forces, the shaft is reinforced with bearings as close to the nozzle as possible.<br>
